The only time the SCM requests ownership of the lock is when it is starting a service.A program that acquires the SCM database lock and fails to release it prevents the SCM from starting other services. Because of the severity of this issue, processes are no longer allowed to lock the database. For compatibility with older applications, the LockServiceDatabase function returns a lock but has no other effect.Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  Acquiring the SCM database lock prevents the SCM from starting a service until the lock is released. For example, a program that must configure several related services before any of them starts could call LockServiceDatabase before configuring the first service. Alternatively, it could ensure that none of the services are started until the configuration has been completed.A call to the StartService function to start a service in a locked database fails. No other SCM functions are affected by a lock.The lock is held until the SC_LOCK handle is specified in a subsequent call to the UnlockServiceDatabase function. If a process that owns a lock terminates, the SCM automatically cleans up and releases ownership of the lock.Failing to release the lock can cause system problems.

To get extended error information, call GetLastError.The following error codes can be set by the service control manager. Other error codes can be set by the registry functions that are called by the service control manager.A ServiceMain function first calls the RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx function to get the service's SERVICE_STATUS_HANDLE. Then it immediately calls the SetServiceStatus function to notify the service control manager that its status is SERVICE_START_PENDING. During initialization, the service can provide updated status to indicate that it is making progress but it needs more time. A common bug is for the service to have the main thread perform the initialization while a separate thread continues to call SetServiceStatus to prevent the service control manager from marking it as hung. However, if the main thread hangs, then the service start ends up in an infinite loop because the worker thread continues to report that the main thread is making progress.After processing a control request, the service's Handler function must call SetServiceStatus if the service status changes to report its new status to the service control manager. It is only necessary to do so when the service is changing state, such as when it is processing stop or shutdown controls. A service can also use this function at any time from any thread of the service to notify the service control manager of state changes, such as when the service must stop due to a recoverable error.A service can call this function only after it has called RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx to get a service status handle.If a service calls SetServiceStatus with the dwCurrentState member set to SERVICE_STOPPED and the dwWin32ExitCode member set to a nonzero value, the following entry is written into the System event log:The following are best practices when calling this function:For an example, see Writing a ServiceMain Function.HandlerExRegisterServiceCtrlHandlerExSERVICE_STATUSService FunctionsServiceMainSetServiceBits</param>

To get extended error information, call GetLastError.The following error code can be set by the service control manager. Other error codes can be set by the registry functions that are called by the service control manager.When the service control manager starts a service process, it waits for the process to call the StartServiceCtrlDispatcher function. The main thread of a service process should make this call as soon as possible after it starts up (within 30 seconds). If StartServiceCtrlDispatcher succeeds, it connects the calling thread to the service control manager and does not return until all running services in the process have entered the SERVICE_STOPPED state. The service control manager uses this connection to send control and service start requests to the main thread of the service process. The main thread acts as a dispatcher by invoking the appropriate HandlerEx function to handle control requests, or by creating a new thread to execute the appropriate ServiceMain function when a new service is started.The lpServiceTable parameter contains an entry for each service that can run in the calling process. Each entry specifies the ServiceMain function for that service. For SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS services, each entry must contain the name of a service. This name is the service name that was specified by the CreateService function when the service was installed. For SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS services, the service name in the table entry is ignored.If a service runs in its own process, the main thread of the service process should immediately call StartServiceCtrlDispatcher. All initialization tasks are done in the service's ServiceMain function when the service is started.If multiple services share a process and some common process-wide initialization needs to be done before any ServiceMain function is called, the main thread can do the work before calling StartServiceCtrlDispatcher, as long as it takes less than 30 seconds. Otherwise, another thread must be created to do the process-wide initialization, while the main thread calls StartServiceCtrlDispatcher and becomes the service control dispatcher. Any service-specific initialization should still be done in the individual service main functions.Services should not attempt to display a user interface directly.

        /// <param name="lpServiceStartTable">A pointer to an array of SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY structures containing one entry for each service that can execute in the calling process. The members of the last entry in the table must have NULL values to designate the end of the table.If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.The following error code can be set by the service control manager. Other error codes can be set by the registry functions that are called by the service control manager.When the service control manager starts a service process, it waits for the process to call the StartServiceCtrlDispatcher function. The main thread of a service process should make this call as soon as possible after it starts up (within 30 seconds). If StartServiceCtrlDispatcher succeeds, it connects the calling thread to the service control manager and does not return until all running services in the process have entered the SERVICE_STOPPED state. The service control manager uses this connection to send control and service start requests to the main thread of the service process. The main thread acts as a dispatcher by invoking the appropriate HandlerEx function to handle control requests, or by creating a new thread to execute the appropriate ServiceMain function when a new service is started.The lpServiceTable parameter contains an entry for each service that can run in the calling process. Each entry specifies the ServiceMain function for that service. For SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS services, each entry must contain the name of a service. This name is the service name that was specified by the CreateService function when the service was installed. For SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS services, the service name in the table entry is ignored.If a service runs in its own process, the main thread of the service process should immediately call StartServiceCtrlDispatcher. All initialization tasks are done in the service's ServiceMain function when the service is started.If multiple services share a process and some common process-wide initialization needs to be done before any ServiceMain function is called, the main thread can do the work before calling StartServiceCtrlDispatcher, as long as it takes less than 30 seconds. Otherwise, another thread must be created to do the process-wide initialization, while the main thread calls StartServiceCtrlDispatcher and becomes the service control dispatcher. Any service-specific initialization should still be done in the individual service main functions.Services should not attempt to display a user interface directly.
